                <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="4" data-line-end="5">From a very general point of view, web development can be defined as all the actions associated with developing websites for the internet. This includes things like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_design">web design</a>, web content development, client-side and server-side scripting and network security configurations, among other things.</p>
                <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="6" data-line-end="7">In a broader sense, web development includes all the actions, updates and operations required to build and maintain and manage a website to ensure that its performance, user experience and speed are satisfactory.</p>
                <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="8" data-line-end="9">Examples of web applications are social networking sites such as <a href="https://www.facebook.com/">FaceBook</a>, music listening sites such <a href="https://www.spotify.com/">Spotify</a>, online purchasing sites such as <a href="https://www.amazon.com/">Amazon</a> among many others. Can you identify some on your own?</p>

                <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="12" data-line-end="13">The process of building a web application is a journey. During this web development series, I will be walking you through on how you can start creating your own web applications all the way through to making them available and accessible to other people.</p>
