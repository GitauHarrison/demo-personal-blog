                <h5>Background</h5>                
                <p>
                    I have been developing software for over a year alongside being a full-time employee in a leading Kids STEM Learning Center in Nairobi.
                    I am currently focusing on Python and Flask for web development.
                </p>
                <h5>My Location</h5>
                <p>
                    Currently, I am based in Nairobi, Kenya. This is my home city. I would love to return to Gangnam-gu, Seoul, South Korea. While there, during a 
                    visit to EMCAST, I actively began to work on developing production software.
                </p>
                <h5>My Interests</h5>
                <p>
                    I blog about programming for now. However, I am also very interested in physical computing, capentry, musical instruments, fitness and wellness and motorsports. 
                    Only these do I engage myself in 100% of the time. I cannot hold any conversation outside these listed items. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have no other social media presence other than the necessary work sites such as GitHub and local programming communities near me.
                    And now that I have this blog, this will be my find-me-here-any-time social media platform of choice. 
                </p> 
                <h5>My Gratitude</h5>
